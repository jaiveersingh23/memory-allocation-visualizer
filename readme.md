# Memory Allocation Visualization Tool

## Description
This project visualizes how different memory allocation algorithms work. It supports three memory allocation techniques:
- **First Fit**
- **Best Fit**
- **Worst Fit**

Users can input a list of process sizes, select the allocation algorithm, and see the memory allocation process with visual representations.

## Features
- Visualizes memory allocation using different algorithms.
- Allows users to input process sizes and select the allocation algorithm.
- Displays the state of memory blocks before and after allocation.

## How to Use
1. Enter a list of process sizes in the input field (comma-separated, e.g. `100, 200, 150`).
2. Select an algorithm: First Fit, Best Fit, or Worst Fit.
3. Click **Allocate Memory** to see the results.
